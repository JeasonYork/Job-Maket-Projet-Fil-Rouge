🧑‍💻 Our Tech Team
They transform complex challenges into elegant solutions!
Their ambition is to have a positive impact on the everyday lives of hundreds of millions of consumers around the world by helping them shop smarter. Joko's engineers work hand-in-hand with Joko's product managers, from exploration, design, and roadmap prioritization to technical specification, implementation, and deployment in production. We have experienced firsthand that teams where engineers have a wide range of skills and where engineering and product collaborate closely ship the best features, offering a truly delightful user experience to our users.

The technical challenges that we are trying to solve at Joko are complex and diverse. For example, we are building our own web browser and are processing massive volumes of transactions every day.

Software development: You will be responsible for the implementation of your software designs from A to Z, across our entire technical stack.
Deployment & monitoring in production: You will be responsible for releasing your projects and monitoring their impact on the users together with the Product team.
Tools & processes: You will help improve the way the Engineering team works by proposing new methods and by developing internal tools.
Preferred Experience
Problem solver: You have strong analytical skills, you are creative, and you love solving complex problems.
Fast learner: You are comfortable in any technical environment and are able to quickly learn new programming languages, new frameworks, or new practices.
Programming skills: You master at least one programming language and you are able to write flawless code that respects the very best practices.
Computer sciences background: You have a solid knowledge of the core computer science concepts, such as algorithms and data structures.
Tech savvy: You are constantly looking at emerging technologies and you keep a close eye on the latest trends in the domain.
Efficiency: You are fond of productivity tools and able to deliver on time on projects with many stakeholders.
Attention to detail: You know that the devil is in the details, and you have a talent for spotting flaws when they exist.
Mindset: You have an entrepreneurial mindset, you like challenges, you welcome feedback and you are willing to get better every day to reach excellence.
Communication: You have strong written and verbal communication skills, and you are able to explain something complex with simple words.
Languages: You are fluent in English both written and spoken, as we are expanding internationally soon. Mastering French is not required.
Education: You are a graduate student in Computer Sciences at an engineering school or a university.
Recruitment Process
15-min call with the Hiring Manager
45-min personality interview with two team members
Live tests with team members
45-min Founders interview

LinkedIn,Full Stack Developer,Builder.ai,"Antibes, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France",https://fr.linkedin.com/jobs/view/full-stack-developer-at-builder-ai-3682836908?position=48&pageNum=0&refId=4GOb2FVwGd%2FhAb4BG0QHJQ%3D%3D&trackingId=uo7P%2Fhacoe4YzyrwFjQetw%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_jserp-result_search-card,"About Us
Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
Life at Builder
It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint-hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less, and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEART (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.
Our scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild

It allows a user to search and book a business trip in a user friendly and performent web application. It gives him access to different transport modes and travel suppliers within the travel policy set by his company.
It then gives them the opportunity to claim additional expenses for reimbursement. This includes expenses captured from credit cards statements, OCR of receipts, and manually entered claims. The service allows to capture VAT, compute policies and reimbursement rules, and much more. Many of those data are either personal or sensitive, which means a strong commitment to secure principles and compliance to certifications such as PCI-DSS.

More About Hopper
At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
Through HTS , our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.
Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.
Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.
Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.
Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Une de nos talentueuses squads cherche une ou un compagnon de jeu pour venir l'aider à ranger et modulariser leur code base legacy, tout en continuant à délivrer de la valeur à nos utilisateurs·trices.
Tu maitrises le C#, es intéressé·e·s par les APIs, l’archi hexagonale, le Domain Driven Design qui consiste à mettre le métier (et ses languages) au coeur de tes préoccupations et actions ?
Tu vois le code legacy non pas comme un fardeau, mais comme l'opportunité d’exploiter tes qualités de crafteuse ou crafteur en terme de refactoring, de TDD et d'avancement en mode baby steps ?
Enthousiaste et proactif·ve, tu aimes partager ou apprendre des autres ?
Tu rêves d'avoir enfin accès à des Product Managers au quotidien, voire à des véritables utilisateurs (au lieu de parler à des proxy, de proxy, de proxy, de proxy, de PO ;-) ?
Mais surtout, tu aimes faire partie d'une équipe autonome et travailler à plusieurs (pair/mob) ?
Contactez-nous : on a hâte de faire ta connaissance, et de te présenter tes futur·e·s collègues, les enjeux de notre scale-up, ainsi que de ton futur poste!!
👉 Dans ce podcast, Lucas, notre CTO, parle de la qualité chez Agicap

Tu pratiques le TDD
Tu connais les principaux code smells ainsi que des techniques de refactoring
Le concept de modular monolith te parle
Tu comprends l’intérêt de faire du Continuous Delivery (encore mieux si tu as déjà fait du trunk-based)

For over 20 years we've scoured the earth to find hotels that stand out for their style, service, and personality — regardless of price. In fact, our painstaking curation led to Michelin making us the official hotel selection of their legendary MICHELIN Guide. The MICHELIN Guide has always been a benchmark in gastronomy. Now it’s setting the same standard for hotels.
Our mission is to open doors to places people will love that they might not have found on their own, extraordinary places that reflect the beauty and diversity of the world. Our team believes that travel brings people of all backgrounds together. Our hotels provide an unforgettable backdrop for that union.
Headquartered in New York City, we operate in eight languages, bringing the top 1% of hotels in over a hundred different countries around the world to our discerning clientele via our website and app. And if you really want to take it to the next level, our Plus membership program provides VIP upgrades and amenities at hundreds of our properties.
Backend Engineer
Part of the Michelin Experiences group (gastronomy and travel), The MICHELIN Guide and Tablet Hotels brands maintain five platforms used by a global consumer facing audience. Our Backend Engineering team is focused on supporting and expanding functionality of restaurant search, hotel booking, payment processing, inventory management, and customer engagement systems and features used across brands and platforms.
We’re creating a new User Generated Content team immediately tasked with building features allowing users to provide content (images and comments) when highlighting their favorite restaurants. This new team will own the functional scope and evolution of all features related to user generated content (including upcoming social features) used by Michelin Experiences’ global audience.
Though this role is based in Boulogne, you’ll report to the lead engineer of User Engagement and integrate into the already existing software engineering team primarily based in New York City. Following agile methodology, you’ll participate in daily standups and collaborate with a functional squad consisting of back and frontend engineers, QA’s, product, and design leads in order to design, develop, and own scalable and maintainable APIs. You’ll be involved with the full development cycle from scoping and building features to performing code-reviews and debugging production issues.
Requirements
3-5 years software engineering experience with Python
Experience with web frameworks such as Django or Flask
Knowledge of unit testing and continuous integration
Professional level English proficiency
This is a hybrid role requiring two days per week in our Boulogne office.

Historique
Leadformance est une startup fondée à Chambéry en 2007, et dédiée à la stratégie web-to-store des réseaux de points de vente (les grandes enseignes notamment, mais pas que). La société, un peu en avance sur son temps, a trouvé son marché à partir de 2010 avec la plateforme BRIDGE proposée en mode SaaS, menant la petite startup savoyarde jusqu'à l'international (en Chine, au Brésil, en Afrique ... enfin un peu partout). Plus tard, en 2014, la société a été rachetée par Solocal et ce fut l'occasion d'élargir la gamme de fonctionnalités, d'agrandir les équipes, tout en profitant de la force commerciale d'un grand groupe. Voilà pour l'historique ...
C'est quoi notre mission ?
Elle n'a pas changé, elle vise toujours à capter les internautes en ligne, et les rediriger en magasin : c'est le web-to-store. Le but est de dynamiser le business local. Aujourd'hui ça parait juste normal avec la situation Covid, mais en 2010 c'était vraiment novateur pour une enseigne de disposer de son propre Store Locator permettant de localiser les magasins de son réseau.
Quelle entreprise vous allez rejoindre ?
Vous allez rejoindre Solocal (2500 personnes), entreprise française basée à Boulogne-Billancourt, Bordeaux, Rennes, Angoulême et Vienne (en Autriche). Plus précisément, vous allez rejoindre l'entité Leadformance, filiale à 100% de Solocal, société basée à Grenoble.
Et dans quelle équipe ?
Vous allez rejoindre la R&D de BRIDGE. Les équipes techniques représentent la moitié du staff Leadformance, soit environ 30 personnes. 40% de ces personnes sont localisées à Grenoble, 40% à Grenoble, et 20% en offshore. Il y a un mix de développeurs junior ou senior, d'intégrateurs web, de dev front / back, de devops et aussi d'ops.
La culture tech et l'équipe tech
Les quatre piliers sont : full-stack, microservice, qualité (TDD, audit de sécurité ... etc) , devops
Toutes les équipes fonctionnent en mode full stack. Tous les développeurs sont full stack, mais souvent chacun a son domaine de prédilection. Cela permet à chaque équipe de gérer un projet de A à Z , tout en laissant l'opportunité à chacun d'aller contribuer sur son domaine, ou au contraire d'aller contribuer sur une techno / une stack technique qu'il/elle ne connait pas. La plateforme est composée d'une trentaine de micro services qui sont tous largement testés, avec beaucoup des tests unitaires, des tests d'intégrations et des tests end to end. Chaque build permet de dérouler ces tests et donner du feedback au développeur. Enfin l'équipe pratique le devops puisque les micro services développées par une équipe sont conçus, développés, testés, packagés et déployés par l'équipe agile. Les ops font partie de la R&D et ils contribuent à la construction de la plateforme beaucoup plus qu'ils ne font des opérations.
Les outils
IntelliJ & VSCode selon les envies, Github & Gitlab selon les projets, Slack et MS Teams selon l'audience, O365 et MacBook Pro.
Le management
Basé sur les concepts de flat management, de confiance et d'autonomie, vous trouverez un environnement propice au travail collaboratif et à l'amélioration continue.
Le Poste : c'est quoi un Full-Stack Engineer chez Leadformance / Solocal ?
La première chose attendue chez un Full-Stack Engineer est ... son savoir être. En effet le flat management implique énormément de discussions en transverse (horizontal) à l'inverse d'un management vertical. Cela requiert de la part de chaque membre de l'équipe une grande capacité à écouter, argumenter, convaincre, et faire des compromis.
D'un point de vue technique, Typescript est le langage le plus utilisé, mais la liste des autres technologies utilisées est longue, donc la polyvalence est de loin la compétence technique la plus recherchée. Une certaine aisance sur les architectures complexes est nécessaire.
La liste exhaustive : NodeJS (Express + Nest), PHP/Symfony, Java/Keycloak, Python/Django, RabbitMQ, Docker/Kubernetes, Jenkins, Sonar, Git
Avantages
Des collègues sympas :)

Who We Are
Loft Orbital builds “shareable” satellites, providing a fast & simple path to orbit for organizations that require access to space. Powered by our hardware & software products, we operate satellites, fly customer payloads onboard, and handle entire missions from end to end - significantly reducing the lead-time and risk of a traditional space mission.
Our standard interface enables us to fly multiple customer payloads on the same satellite, with capabilities such as earth imagery, weather & climate /science data collection, IoT connectivity, in-orbit demonstrations, and national security missions. Our customers trust us to manage their space infrastructure, so they can focus on what matters most to them: operating their mission and collecting their data.
At Loft, you’ll be given the autonomy and ownership to solve significant challenges, but with a close-knit and supportive team at your back. We believe that diversity and community are the foundation of an open culture. We are committed to hiring the best people regardless of background and make their time at Loft the most fulfilling period of their career.
We value kind, supportive and team-oriented collaborators. It is also crucial for us that you are a problem solver and a great communicator. As our team is international, you will need strong English skills to better collaborate, easily communicate complex ideas and convey important messages.
With 3 satellites on-orbit and a wave of exciting missions launching soon, we are scaling up quickly across our offices in San Francisco, CA | Golden, CO | and Toulouse, France.
As an international company your resume will be reviewed by people across our offices so please attach a copy in English.

More About Hopper
At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.
The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.
While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.
Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.
Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.
Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.
Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.
Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.
Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.
Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.
Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

That will include things like synchoronizing a code-generated library for reading/writing config settings between the server and the client (like feature configuration, feature flags, etc.).
Roadmap Creation and Ideation
You’ll also be an active participant of a the roadmap creation and ideation. You’ll be expected to help identify the right tradeoffs and bring ideas from a product and engineering perspective.

Life at amo
To ensure that everyone is set up for success within our way of working, we work together onsite 5 days a week.
We wanted to make sure coming to the office is as comfortable as possible for you:
We chose a location in central Paris, near Opera (Metro lines 3,8,9 and RER A).
We have a beautiful Parisian-style office with high ceilings, balconies, and huge windows. So a lot of natural light!
We reimburse your commuting expenses 100%.
Because life outside of work should also be stress-free, we cover:
Health care (100% coverage).
Maternity Leave, Paternity Leave, Second Parent Leave (salary maintained at 100%).
We shut down entirely twice a year — two weeks in the summer and one week in the winter to allow everyone to truly recharge and to avoid prolonged slowdowns (especially in the summer). This enables everyone to actually disconnect and enjoy their vacation. No Slack, no email, no FOMO. Per French standard, we also offer another 4 weeks to allow team members to choose when they want to take time off.
We love the diverse perspectives we get from having people from all over the world join us, and so we of course support relocation to Paris with:

We value team members who delve deep into their respective domains, aiming to cultivate a team of subject matter experts. This commitment to expertise is an expectation for every team member.
As a Staff Android Engineer, your day-to-day will include:
Feature Development
You will be at the forefront of delivering unique and high-quality UI features in a fast-paced environment. We encourage pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and your expertise in low-level APIs, shader creation for dynamic effects, and custom rendering systems will be invaluable.
Platform Development
Active participation in creating and enhancing the platform is part of your role. This involves contributing to the development of code-generated libraries, synchronization of server-client configurations, and the implementation of cross-platform, real-time, type-safe analytics systems.
Roadmap Creation and Ideation
You will be a key player in the roadmap creation and ideation process. Your experience will be essential in identifying tradeoffs and bringing valuable ideas from both product and engineering perspectives.
Knowledge Sharing
We value continuous learning and knowledge sharing. Your active participation in staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices, attending conferences, engaging in online communities, and sharing your insights internally will contribute to our collective growth.
Your Skills & Experience
5+ years of overall developer experience, ideally with professional experience in native Android development using Kotlin or Java.
Good understanding of computer systems fundamentals (Program execution, Linking, Multithreading, etc.).
Professional experience in low-level languages like C, C++ or Rust is a significant advantage!
Experience in Graphics Programming using APIs such as OpenGL, Vulkan or Metal.
Passion and experience building consumer-facing products - we’d love to hear about apps you've made!
Life at amo
To ensure that everyone is set up for success within our way of working, we work together onsite 5 days a week.
We wanted to make sure coming to the office is as comfortable as possible for you:
We chose a location in central Paris, near Opera (Metro lines 3,8,9 and RER A).
We have a beautiful Parisian-style office with high ceilings, balconies, and huge windows. So a lot of natural light!
We reimburse your commuting expenses 100%.
Because life outside of work should also be stress-free, we cover:
Health care (100% coverage).
Maternity Leave, Paternity Leave, Second Parent Leave (salary maintained at 100%).
We shut down entirely twice a year — two weeks in the summer and one week in the winter to allow everyone to truly recharge and to avoid prolonged slowdowns (especially in the summer). This enables everyone to actually disconnect and enjoy their vacation. No Slack, no email, no FOMO. Per French standard, we also offer another 4 weeks to allow team members to choose when they want to take time off.
We love the diverse perspectives we get from having people from all over the world join us, and so we of course support relocation to Paris with:
Help and sponsored visa process.
1 month of Airbnb 100% covered by amo upon arrival.
Assistance from Settlesweet to find your permanent home.
Help with french paperwork like opening a french social security account, tax forms and more.
French lessons to be fully set with your new Parisian life.
