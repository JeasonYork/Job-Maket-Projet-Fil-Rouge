        "description": "About Us\nInnovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.\nWe're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.\nBuilding software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.\nOur human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.\nLife at Builder\nIt’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint-hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less, and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEART (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.\nOur scale-up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild\nDescription\nWe are looking for a Full Stack Developer to produce scalable software solutions. You’ll be part of a cross-functional team that’s responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.\nAs a Full Stack Developer, you should be comfortable around both front-end and back-end coding languages, development frameworks, and third-party libraries. You should also be a team player with a knack for visual design and utility.\nIf you’re also familiar with Agile methodologies, we’d like to meet you.\nWhy You Should Join\nIt is a challenging and diverse role that requires you to improve the existing developer platform, with a constant focus on making the experience better and more feature-packed. While trying to find solutions to problems, which are often overlooked or just too complicated for people to think about solving. Join this role if you are someone who doesn't shy away from creating a path in uncharted territory and is comfortable with trying, failing, and course-correcting fast.\nDeliverables\nWrite reusable, testable, and efficient code\nDesign and implement low-latency, reusable & performant applications\nImplementation of security and data protection\nPerformance tuning, improvement, balancing, usability, automation\nCollaborating with various stakeholders not exclusive to QA, DevOps, PMs, and other developers\nWrite technical documentation.\nRequirements\nProven experience as a Full Stack Developer or similar role\nExperience developing desktop applications for Linux\n2+ years in working with Kubernetes/Docker-based Systems.\n2+ years’ experience of designing/deploying solutions on major cloud providers (AWS/Azure)\nKnowledge of multiple front-end languages and libraries (e.g. HTML/ CSS, JavaScript, jQuery)\nKnowledge of multiple back-end languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Java) and JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Angular, React)\nFamiliarity with databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), web servers (e.g. Apache, Nginx) and UI/UX design\nWorking knowledge of standard CS fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, complexity analysis)\nBenefits\nHealth and wellness benefits\nPerformance-based bonuses and stock options\nEmployee friendly policies\nGenerous vacation and time off benefits, including paid holidays\nGenerally flexible working hour.\nShow more\nShow less",

In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.\nOur fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.\nAlmost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.\nGiven the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.\nThrough HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.\nFeatured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.\nHopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.\nCome take off with us!\nShow more\nShow less",

        "description": "Tablet is how you book the world’s most exciting hotels — places where you get a memorable experience, not just a room for the night. For over 20 years we've scoured the earth to find hotels that stand out for their style, service, and personality — regardless of price. In fact, our painstaking curation led to Michelin making us the official hotel selection of their legendary MICHELIN Guide. The MICHELIN Guide has always been a benchmark in gastronomy. Now it’s setting the same standard for hotels.\nOur mission is to open doors to places people will love that they might not have found on their own, extraordinary places that reflect the beauty and diversity of the world. Our team believes that travel brings people of all backgrounds together. Our hotels provide an unforgettable backdrop for that union.\nHeadquartered in New York City, we operate in eight languages, bringing the top 1% of hotels in over a hundred different countries around the world to our discerning clientele via our website and app. And if you really want to take it to the next level, our Plus membership program provides VIP upgrades and amenities at hundreds of our properties.\nBackend Engineer\nPart of the Michelin Experiences group (gastronomy and travel), The MICHELIN Guide and Tablet Hotels brands maintain five platforms used by a global consumer facing audience. Our Backend Engineering team is focused on supporting and expanding functionality of restaurant search, hotel booking, payment processing, inventory management, and customer engagement systems and features used across brands and platforms.\nWe’re creating a new User Generated Content team immediately tasked with building features allowing users to provide content (images and comments) when highlighting their favorite restaurants. This new team will own the functional scope and evolution of all features related to user generated content (including upcoming social features) used by Michelin Experiences’ global audience.\nThough this role is based in Boulogne, you’ll report to the lead engineer of User Engagement and integrate into the already existing software engineering team primarily based in New York City. Following agile methodology, you’ll participate in daily standups and collaborate with a functional squad consisting of back and frontend engineers, QA’s, product, and design leads in order to design, develop, and own scalable and maintainable APIs. You’ll be involved with the full development cycle from scoping and building features to performing code-reviews and debugging production issues.\nRequirements\n3-5 years software engineering experience with Python\nExperience with web frameworks such as Django or Flask\nKnowledge of unit testing and continuous integration\nProfessional level English proficiency\nThis is a hybrid role requiring two days per week in our Boulogne office.\nShow more\nShow less",

        "description": "Le résumé en quatre lignes ci dessous ...\nLieu\n: Montbonnot-Saint-Martin\nAvantages\n: multi techno, multi projets, niveau technique élevé, une volonté de bien faire en produisant de la valeur, un management à l'écoute\nStack technique\n: Angular (monorepo Nx), NodeJS (Express & NestJS), MongoDB, TypeScript, Python/Django, Php / Symfony, Java, RMQ, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes\nProfil recherché\n: Full-Stack Engineer\nEt pour ceux qui veulent en savoir plus ...\nHistorique\nLeadformance est une startup fondée à Chambéry en 2007, et dédiée à la stratégie web-to-store des réseaux de points de vente (les grandes enseignes notamment, mais pas que). La société, un peu en avance sur son temps, a trouvé son marché à partir de 2010 avec la plateforme BRIDGE proposée en mode SaaS, menant la petite startup savoyarde jusqu'à l'international (en Chine, au Brésil, en Afrique ... enfin un peu partout). Plus tard, en 2014, la société a été rachetée par Solocal et ce fut l'occasion d'élargir la gamme de fonctionnalités, d'agrandir les équipes, tout en profitant de la force commerciale d'un grand groupe. Voilà pour l'historique ...\nC'est quoi notre mission ?\nElle n'a pas changé, elle vise toujours à capter les internautes en ligne, et les rediriger en magasin : c'est le web-to-store. Le but est de dynamiser le business local. Aujourd'hui ça parait juste normal avec la situation Covid, mais en 2010 c'était vraiment novateur pour une enseigne de disposer de son propre Store Locator permettant de localiser les magasins de son réseau.\nQuelle entreprise vous allez rejoindre ?\nVous allez rejoindre Solocal (2500 personnes), entreprise française basée à Boulogne-Billancourt, Bordeaux, Rennes, Angoulême et Vienne (en Autriche). Plus précisément, vous allez rejoindre l'entité Leadformance, filiale à 100% de Solocal, société basée à Grenoble.\nEt dans quelle équipe ?\nVous allez rejoindre la R&D de BRIDGE. Les équipes techniques représentent la moitié du staff Leadformance, soit environ 30 personnes. 40% de ces personnes sont localisées à Grenoble, 40% à Grenoble, et 20% en offshore. Il y a un mix de développeurs junior ou senior, d'intégrateurs web, de dev front / back, de devops et aussi d'ops.\nLa culture tech et l'équipe tech\nLes quatre piliers sont : full-stack, microservice, qualité (TDD, audit de sécurité ... etc) , devops\nToutes les équipes fonctionnent en mode full stack. Tous les développeurs sont full stack, mais souvent chacun a son domaine de prédilection. Cela permet à chaque équipe de gérer un projet de A à Z , tout en laissant l'opportunité à chacun d'aller contribuer sur son domaine, ou au contraire d'aller contribuer sur une techno / une stack technique qu'il/elle ne connait pas. La plateforme est composée d'une trentaine de micro services qui sont tous largement testés, avec beaucoup des tests unitaires, des tests d'intégrations et des tests end to end. Chaque build permet de dérouler ces tests et donner du feedback au développeur. Enfin l'équipe pratique le devops puisque les micro services développées par une équipe sont conçus, développés, testés, packagés et déployés par l'équipe agile. Les ops font partie de la R&D et ils contribuent à la construction de la plateforme beaucoup plus qu'ils ne font des opérations.\nLes outils\nIntelliJ & VSCode selon les envies, Github & Gitlab selon les projets, Slack et MS Teams selon l'audience, O365 et MacBook Pro.\nLe management\nBasé sur les concepts de flat management, de confiance et d'autonomie, vous trouverez un environnement propice au travail collaboratif et à l'amélioration continue.\nLe Poste : c'est quoi un Full-Stack Engineer chez Leadformance / Solocal ?\nLa première chose attendue chez un Full-Stack Engineer est ... son savoir être. En effet le flat management implique énormément de discussions en transverse (horizontal) à l'inverse d'un management vertical. Cela requiert de la part de chaque membre de l'équipe une grande capacité à écouter, argumenter, convaincre, et faire des compromis.\nD'un point de vue technique, Typescript est le langage le plus utilisé, mais la liste des autres technologies utilisées est longue, donc la polyvalence est de loin la compétence technique la plus recherchée. Une certaine aisance sur les architectures complexes est nécessaire.\nLa liste exhaustive : NodeJS (Express + Nest), PHP/Symfony, Java/Keycloak, Python/Django, RabbitMQ, Docker/Kubernetes, Jenkins, Sonar, Git\nAvantages\nDes collègues sympas :)\nCarte tickets restaurant\nMutuelle entreprise + Prévoyance\nParticipation + Intéressement\nTélé-travail (2j par semaine)\nRémunération attractive selon profil\nAdresse : 100 allée Saint Exupéry, 38330 Montbonnot-Saint-Martin\nCa vous tente ?\nPostulez et on vous dira plus dès le premier entretien\nPowered by JazzHR\nmiAj2Jn9Zy\nShow more\nShow less",

You’ll collaborate with peers on the Frontend Engineering team, as well as interface with the wider Ground Software team.\nResearch shows that while men apply to jobs where they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized people tend to only apply when they meet 100% of the qualifications. At Loft, we value respectful debate and people who aren’t afraid to challenge assumptions. We strongly encourage you to apply, even if you don’t ‘check all the boxes\nAbout the Role:\nDesign the tools for operations, autopilot observability and activity tracking\nWriting code - developing our apps and services\nCollaborate with the UI/UX design team\nInterfacing with BE services\nProvide support with using ground software (Cockpit)\nS/C Ops - everybody is involved\nMust Haves:\nStrong proficiency in TypeScript / HTML / CSS\nExperience with React or Vue\nExperience working on SPAs\nExperience working with GraphQL APIs\nExperience with Docker\nNice to Haves:\nExperience with Web Components\nExperience with Geospatial data handling\nUI/UX sensibility (no need to be a designer, just to care about that)\nSome of Our Awesome Benefits:\nEquity, we want you to have an active role in our successUp to 35 days of Paid Time Off (vacations & RTT ) and flexible working hours, we want you to be at your best\nHealth and life insurance, we care about your health\nLunch Vouchers, because let’s be honest, we love food!

Powered by our hardware & software products, we operate satellites, fly customer payloads onboard, and handle entire missions from end to end - significantly reducing the lead-time and risk of a traditional space mission.\nOur standard interface enables us to fly multiple customer payloads on the same satellite, with capabilities such as earth imagery, weather & climate /science data collection, IoT connectivity, in-orbit demonstrations, and national security missions. Our customers trust us to manage their space infrastructure, so they can focus on what matters most to them: operating their mission and collecting their data.\nAt Loft, you’ll be given the autonomy and ownership to solve significant challenges, but with a close-knit and supportive team at your back. We believe that diversity and community are the foundation of an open culture. We are committed to hiring the best people regardless of background and make their time at Loft the most fulfilling period of their career.\nWe value kind, supportive and team-oriented collaborators. It is also crucial for us that you are a problem solver and a great communicator. As our team is international, you will need strong English skills to better collaborate, easily communicate complex ideas and convey important messages.\nWith 3 satellites on-orbit and a wave of exciting missions launching soon, we are scaling up quickly across our offices in San Francisco, CA | Golden, CO | and Toulouse, France.\nAs an international company your resume will be reviewed by people across our offices so please attach a copy in English.\nShow more\nShow less",

By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.\nThe Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.\nWhile everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.\nThrough HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.\nHere are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:\nHopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.\nOur fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.\nAlmost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.\nGiven the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.\nThrough HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.\nFeatured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.\nHopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world.
